<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a PhD Candidate at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

I'm passionate about statistical teaching pedagogy, fostering inclusivity, and building community in the classroom. 

My research interests are building mixture models to quantify the effects of built environment, environmental pollution, and social determinants on health outcomes.
